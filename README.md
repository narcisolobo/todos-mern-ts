# MERN Todos Project with TypeScript

As I learn TypeScript, I'm building on my knowledge bit by bit the best way I know how - by building simple projects.

This is my first attempt at building a type-safe MERN project. I've also been leaning super-heavily on Bootstrap lately, so I thought I'd also start learning Tailwind CSS on this one, too.
